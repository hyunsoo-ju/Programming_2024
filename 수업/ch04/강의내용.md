# Program control

- counter-controlled iteration
- for, do...while
- switch
- break, continue
- logical operators to from complex conditional expressions in control statements
- avoid the consequences of confusing the assignment operator with the equality operator

## EOF

End of file

in unix, ctrl+d is used to signal EOF

## switch

```c
switch (expression) {
    case constant1:
        statement;
        break;
    case constant2:
        statement;
        break;
    default:
        statement;
}
```

expression must be an integer or character constant(converted to ascii value)

break is used to exit the switch statement after a case is executed

if switch is inside a loop, break will only exit the switch statement, not the loop

### "" & ''

"" is used for strings, '' is used for characters

so, use '' for switch cases

## for

```c
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    statement;
}
```

by using ```break```, you can exit the loop

by using ```continue```, you can skip the rest of the loop and go to the next iteration

```c
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        continue;
    }
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

this will print 0 to 4, 6 to 9

not 1 input 1 output -> should remove line upward and rightward

## pow

takes 2 double as input, returns double

## scanf

takes many arguments, format string and address of variable and returns integer

if scanf is successful, it returns 1, if not, 0

meaning by that scanf is successful, it means that it has read the required input and stored it in the variable
